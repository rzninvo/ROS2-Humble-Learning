# ROS2-Humble-Learning
This is a repository for myself in which I am actively trying to learn ROS2 Humble for both C++ and Python.

## ROS2 Humble Tutorial Packages
Most of the packages in the workspace are written according to the [`ROS2 Humble`](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html) docs.

## ROS2 Industrial Training Packages
Some of the packages are written according to the [`ROS2 Industrial Training`](https://industrial-training-master.readthedocs.io/en/humble/index.html) docs.

## Notable Packages:
* [ROS2 PCL Training Package](https://github.com/rzninvo/ROS2-Humble-Learning/tree/main/src/lesson_perception): A package from the ROS2 Industrial Training docs that covers how to write **Pointcloud Perception Nodes**.
